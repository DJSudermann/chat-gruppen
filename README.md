# Building ChurchTools-Plugins

With this project you get a boilerplate for building your own plugin for [ChurchTools](https://www.church.tools).

## Configuration

Copy `.env-example` to `.env` and fill in your data.
In the `.env` you can configure the necessary constants to start with your project. With that, the ChurchTools-Client is ready to go and you can start using the ChurchTools-API. The `.env` is included in `.gitignore` and should never be checked in into a public repository!

So: Happy coding

For questions concerning the API reach out in the [Forum](https://forum.church.tools).
